## INTRODUCTION

Manuscript title: "Chimpanzee pant-hoots encode information about individual but not group differences"

Manuscript authors: Nisarg P. Desai, Pawel Fedurek, Katie E. Slocombe, Michael L. Wilson

Code author: Nisarg P. Desai. Utilized functions written by Roger Mundry and Christof Neumann

The repo contains data extractracted form spectrogram representations of chimpanzee pant-hoot vocalizations and code to perform the analyses to explore the existence of vocal dialects. The code requires proprietary functions to run permuted discriminant functions analysis (pDFA) available from Dr. Roger Mundry.

Kanyawara recordings owned by Dr. Pawel Fedurek and Dr. Katie Slocombe.
